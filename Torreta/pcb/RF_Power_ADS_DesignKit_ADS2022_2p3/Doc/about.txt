Version:  2.3
	Version 2.3 adds ADS2022 binaries for Linux and Windows.
	
Version:  2.2
	Version 2.2 adds ADS2020 binaries for Linux, and ADS2021 binaries for Windows and Linux.
	
Version:  2.1
	Version 2.1 adds ADS2020 binaries, and updates GAN_WFE model for ADS2016, ADS2017, and ADS2019
	with improved convergence in load pull simulations.
	
Version:  2.0
	Version 2.0 adds new model, 'GAN_WFE'.  Verified that VS2015 binaries work in ADS 2019.
	
Version:  1.9
	Version 1.9 adds ADS2017 binaries without any model code changes.
	
Version:  1.8.1
	Version 1.8.1 adds new parameter, 'Intrinsic', to the 'FSLRFPK_FET2_WFE' model enabling access to the
	internal to drain-to-source and capacitive currents for waveform engineering.  This new parameter
	is toggled between 1 and 0.  Setting this parameter to 1 enables the internal intrinsic currents.
	These currents then return real values.  Setting this parameter to 0 disables these internal
	intrinsic currents. Once disabled these currents return 0.
	
Version:  1.8
	Version 1.8 adds new model, 'FSLRFPK_FET2_WFE', for waveform engineering supports access to the
	internal to drain-to-source and capacitive currents in ADS2016 only.  This new model also
	supports multi-threading to decrease simulation time.
	Version 1.8 updates existing model, 'FSLRFPK_FET2_INT',
	to support multi-threading to decrease simulation time in ADS2016 only.
	
Version:  1.7.2
	Version 1.7.2 adds internal gate access to, 'FSLRFPK_FET2_INT', model for existing FET2
	in ADS2012, ADS2014 and ADS2015 binaries without any model code changes.
	
Version:  1.7.1
	Version 1.7.1 adds new model, 'FSLRFPK_FET2_INT', supporting internal drain access for
	existing FET2 in ADS2012 and ADS2014 binaries without any model code changes.
	
Version:  1.7
	Version 1.7 adds ADS2014 binaries without any model code changes.
	
Version:  1.6
	Version 1.6 adds ADS2012 binaries without any model code changes.
	
Version:  1.5
	Version 1.5 offers a convergence fix/improvement when the argument of the functions 
	using exp() goes below -20.0 to limit the minimum to -20.0.
	Also, for ADS2011, removed the loading of the library and palette ael files
	from the CmdOp vocabulary which caused an issue.  And, made the function
	name in the palette.ael file more unique to avoid namespace clashing.

Version:  1.4
	Version 1.4 Found thermal subcircuit scaling issues of RTH and CTH in the FET2
	model.  These have been wrong since version 1.2.  This version 
	corrects this issue. 
	In Version 1.3 and 1.2, the scaling was inverted so that:
		Rth_new = Rth*Area; and
		Cth_new = Cth/Area;
	Now, it is correct:
		Rth_new = Rth/Area; and
		Cth_new = Cth*Area; 
	Where Area = New_Periphery/Base_Periphery;

	Also, the FET2 model has been enhanced for more robust convergence
	and increased speed.
				
	Components:	FET2		
				Simulator id is 'FSLRFPK_FET2' which is now
				preferred, but the user can still use 'FSLRFPK_FET2_v1'
				to access the same model.
				Description:  Standard FET2 file based
				model used within our external libraries
				and SPDKs.	

Version:  1.3
	Version 1.3 fixed thermal subcircuit issues to use external RTH and CTH.
	Also fixed the QDS voltage referencing to Vggs instead of Vgs.	
				
Version:  1.2
	Version 1.2 fixed scaling of RTH and CTH in the FET2 model.
				
Version:  1.1
	Version 1.1 has added features to those above including the new
	FET2 model.
	    
	Components:	FET2		
				Simulator id is 'FSLRFPK_FET2_v1'
